# Introduction

Source code for the firmware I use on my signal generator based on a Arduino Uno and a breakout board for a AD9833. I'm recycling a old LCD display that can only do 16x1 characters and the user interface is quite simple. Need to order a more modern SPI based display to be able to put all the information in the display. In this initial version is as barebone as it can get.
